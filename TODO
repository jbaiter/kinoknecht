* General
  - cmdline options
  - daemonize
  - plugin api?

* API
   - move api functions from kinoweb proper to own api_handler (with simpleapi)
   - create nice abstraction, think well through


* Database
  - Allow Videofile to handle DVD-Images (*ISO; VIDEO_TS)
  - Differentiate between extras and main
  - posterurl
  - generate thumbnails/preview screens from videofiles (one every 10 minutes)
  - move specs detection from mplayer to ffvideo/ffmpeg for performance

* Playerbackend
  - get res, fbdev from environment
  - Better abstraction
  - restart if crashed or quitted
  - store last position (file, seek) if stopped before finished
  - add streaming option (using ffserver or mencoder [hacky!])

* Webinterface
  - sorting
  - player interface
  - edit interface
  - streaming
